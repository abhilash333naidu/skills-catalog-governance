# M3 COUNCIL BRIEF — commit-message skill family (2026-08-10)

## Framed question (neutral, do not steer)

Three skills in the catalog all handle writing git commit messages, but each comes from a different harness family: (1) caveman-commit (caveman plugin pack), (2) ce-commit (Claude Engineer/ce family), (3) writing-commit-messages (vendored inside herdr/vendor/libghostty-vt). The catalog-governance project must decide whether these three should be consolidated into ONE master skill or kept separate. Binding constraints: at most ONE survivor per group; survivors keep identity (dir + frontmatter name); sources move to archive only after content is absorbed; portability covenant — no AskUserQuestion, no /ce-* commands, no $GSTACK_BIN references, no telemetry; the master must be usable by any harness (Hermes, Claude Code, opencode, codex, OMP).

## Source skills (FULL TEXT — every line must be read)

### 1. caveman-commit (C:\Users\abhil\.agents\skills\caveman-commit\SKILL.md)
```
---
name: caveman-commit
description: >
  Ultra-compressed commit message generator. Cuts noise from commit messages while preserving
  intent and reasoning. Conventional Commits format. Subject ≤50 chars, body only when "why"
  isn't obvious. Use when user says "write a commit", "commit message", "generate commit",
  "/commit", or invokes /caveman-commit. Auto-triggers when staging changes.
---

Write commit messages terse and exact. Conventional Commits format. No fluff. Why over what.

## Rules

**Subject line:**
- `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>` — `<scope>` optional
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `style`, `revert`
- Imperative mood: "add", "fix", "remove" — not "added", "adds", "adding"
- ≤50 chars when possible, hard cap 72
- No trailing period
- Match project convention for capitalization after the colon

**Body (only if needed):**
- Skip entirely when subject is self-explanatory
- Add body only for: non-obvious *why*, breaking changes, migration notes, linked issues
- Wrap at 72 chars
- Bullets `-` not `*`
- Reference issues/PRs at end: `Closes #42`, `Refs #17`

**What NEVER goes in:**
- "This commit does X", "I", "we", "now", "currently" — the diff says what
- "As requested by..." — use Co-authored-by trailer
- "Generated with Claude Code" or any AI attribution — unless the user's own rule requires an `Assisted-by`/AI-attribution trailer, then add it as a trailer
- Emoji (unless project convention requires)
- Restating the file name when scope already says it

## Examples

Diff: new endpoint for user profile with body explaining the why
- ❌ "feat: add a new endpoint to get user profile information from the database"
- ✅
  ```
  feat(api): add GET /users/:id/profile

  Mobile client needs profile data without the full user payload
  to reduce LTE bandwidth on cold-launch screens.

  Closes #128
  ```

Diff: breaking API change
- ✅
  ```
  feat(api)!: rename /v1/orders to /v1/checkout

  BREAKING CHANGE: clients on /v1/orders must migrate to /v1/checkout
  before 2026-06-01. Old route returns 410 after that date.
  ```

## Auto-Clarity

Always include body for: breaking changes, security fixes, data migrations, anything reverting a prior commit. Never compress these into subject-only — future debuggers need the context.

## Boundaries

Only generates the commit message. Does not run `git commit`, does not stage files, does not amend. Output the message as a code block ready to paste. "stop caveman-commit" or "normal mode": revert to verbose commit style.
```

### 2. ce-commit (C:\Users\abhil\.agents\skills\ce-commit\SKILL.md)
```
---
name: ce-commit
description: Create a git commit with a clear, value-communicating message. Use when the user says "commit", "commit this", "save my changes", "create a commit", or wants to commit staged or unstaged work. Produces well-structured commit messages that follow repo conventions when they exist, and defaults to conventional commit format otherwise.
---

# Git Commit

Create a single, well-crafted git commit from the current working tree changes.

## Context

**On platforms other than Claude Code**, skip to the "Context fallback" section below and run the command there to gather context.

**In Claude Code**, the five labeled sections below (Git status, Working tree diff, Current branch, Recent commits, Remote default branch) contain pre-populated data. Use them directly throughout this skill -- do not re-run these commands.

**Git status:**
!`git status`

**Working tree diff:**
!`git diff HEAD`

**Current branch:**
!`git branch --show-current`

**Recent commits:**
!`git log --oneline -10`

**Remote default branch:**
!`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo '__DEFAULT_BRANCH_UNRESOLVED__'`

### Context fallback

**In Claude Code, skip this section — the data above is already available.**

Run this single command to gather all context:

```bash
printf '=== STATUS ===\n'; git status; printf '\n=== DIFF ===\n'; git diff HEAD; printf '\n=== BRANCH ===\n'; git branch --show-current; printf '\n=== LOG ===\n'; git log --oneline -10; printf '\n=== DEFAULT_BRANCH ===\n'; git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo '__DEFAULT_BRANCH_UNRESOLVED__'
```

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather context

Use the context above (git status, working tree diff, current branch, recent commits, remote default branch). All data needed for this step is already available -- do not re-run those commands.

The remote default branch value returns something like `origin/main`. Strip the `origin/` prefix to get the branch name. If it returned `__DEFAULT_BRANCH_UNRESOLVED__` or a bare `HEAD`, try:

```bash
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'
```

If both fail, fall back to `main`.

If the git status from the context above shows a clean working tree (no staged, modified, or untracked files), report that there is nothing to commit and stop.

If the current branch from the context above is empty, the repository is in detached HEAD state. Explain that a branch is required before committing if the user wants this work attached to a branch. Ask whether to create a feature branch now. Use the platform's blocking question tool: `AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code (call `ToolSearch` with `select:AskUserQuestion` first if its schema isn't loaded), `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_user` in Gemini, `ask_user` in Pi (requires the `pi-ask-user` extension). Fall back to presenting options in chat only when no blocking tool exists in the harness or the call errors (e.g., Codex edit modes) — not because a schema load is required. Never silently skip the question.

- If the user chooses to create a branch, derive the name from the change content, create it with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`, then run `git branch --show-current` again and use that result as the current branch name for the rest of the workflow.
- If the user declines, continue with the detached HEAD commit.

### Step 2: Determine commit message convention

Follow this priority order:

1. **Repo conventions already in context** -- If project instructions (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or similar) are already loaded and specify commit message conventions, follow those. Do not re-read these files; they are loaded at session start.
2. **Recent commit history** -- If no explicit convention is documented, examine the 10 most recent commits from Step 1. If a clear pattern emerges (e.g., conventional commits, ticket prefixes, emoji prefixes), match that pattern.
3. **Default: conventional commits** -- If neither source provides a pattern, use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description` where type is one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `style`, `build`.

When using conventional commits, choose the type that most precisely describes the change (the type list above). Where `fix:` and `feat:` both seem to fit, default to `fix:`: a change that remedies broken or missing behavior is `fix:` even when implemented by adding code. Reserve `feat:` for capabilities the user could not previously accomplish. Other types remain primary when they fit better. The user may override for a specific change.

### Step 3: Consider logical commits

Before staging everything together, scan the changed files for naturally distinct concerns. If modified files clearly group into separate logical changes (e.g., a refactor in one directory and a new feature in another, or test files for a different change than source files), create separate commits for each group.

Keep this lightweight:
- Group at the **file level only** -- do not use `git add -p` or try to split hunks within a file.
- If the separation is obvious (different features, unrelated fixes), split. If it's ambiguous, one commit is fine.
- Two or three logical commits is the sweet spot. Do not over-slice into many tiny commits.

### Step 4: Stage and commit

If the current branch from the context above is `main`, `master`, or the resolved default branch from Step 1, warn the user and ask whether to continue committing here or create a feature branch first. Use the platform's blocking question tool: `AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code (call `ToolSearch` with `select:AskUserQuestion` first if its schema isn't loaded), `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_user` in Gemini, `ask_user` in Pi (requires the `pi-ask-user` extension). Fall back to presenting options in chat only when no blocking tool exists in the harness or the call errors (e.g., Codex edit modes) — not because a schema load is required. Never silently skip the question. If the user chooses to create a branch, derive the name from the change content, create it with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`, then continue.

Write the commit message:
- **Subject line**: Concise, imperative mood, focused on *why* not *what*. Follow the convention determined in Step 2.
- **Body** (when needed): Add a body separated by a blank line for non-trivial changes. Explain motivation, trade-offs, or anything a future reader would need. Omit the body for obvious single-purpose changes.

For each commit group, stage and commit in a single call. Prefer staging specific files by name over `git add -A` or `git add .` to avoid accidentally including sensitive files (.env, credentials) or unrelated changes. Use a heredoc to preserve formatting:

```bash
git add file1 file2 file3 && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): subject line here

Optional body explaining why this change was made,
not just what changed.
EOF
)"
```

### Step 5: Confirm

Run `git status` after the commit to verify success. Report the commit hash(es) and subject line(s).
```

# Writing Commit Messages

Write commit messages that follow commit style guidelines for the project.

## Format

```
<subsystem>: <summary>

<reference issues/PRs/etc.>

<long form description>
```

## Rules

### Subject line

- **Subsystem prefix**: Use a short, lowercase identifier for the
  area of code changed (e.g., `terminal`, `vt`, `lib`, `config`,
  `font`). Determine this from the file paths in the diff. If
  changes span the macOS app, use `macos`. For GTK, use `gtk`. For
  build system, use `build`. Use nested subsystems with `/` when
  helpful and exclusive (e.g., `terminal/osc`).
- **Summary**: Lowercase start (not capitalized), imperative mood,
  no trailing period. Keep it concise—ideally under 60 characters
  total for the whole subject line.

### References

- If the change relates to a GitHub issue, PR, or discussion, list
  the relevant numbers on their own lines after the subject, separated
  by a blank line. E.g. `#1234`
- If there are no references, omit this section entirely (no blank
  line).

### Long form description

- Describe **what changed**, **what the previous behavior was**,
  and **how the new behavior works** at a high level.
- Use plain prose, not bullet points. Wrap lines at ~72 characters.
- Focus on the _why_ and _how_ rather than restating the diff.
- Keep the tone direct and technical without no filler phrases.
- Don't exceed a handful of paragraphs; less is more.

## Workflow

- If `.jj` is present, use `jj` instead of `git` for all commands.
- Run a diff to see what changes are present since the last commit.
- Identify the subsystem from the changed file paths.
- Identify any referenced issues/PRs from the diff context or
  branch name.
- Draft the commit message following the format above.
- Apply the commit
- Don't push the commit; leave that to the user.
